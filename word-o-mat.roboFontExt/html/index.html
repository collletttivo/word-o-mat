<h1>word-o-mat v2.0</h1>

<p>(Apr 30, 2014)</p>
<p>word-o-mat is an extension for RoboFont that generates words for use in type sketching, spacing, testing etc., displaying them directly in the Space Center. 
<br>If you find any bugs or have suggestions for future development, please either fix them or <a href="mailto:altairas_eye@mac.com">send me a line</a>. Help is especially also welcome for making the word lists better; I've gone through the German one manually, but the other non-English ones probably still have quite a few errors. Sorry / please help make them better.<br>
The code is published under an MIT license; please also see the licensing terms of the enclosed word lists.</p>

<h2>Interface Elements</h2> 

<p><strong>Word Count</strong></p>
<p>Specify the number of words that should be generated. (Be advised that using large numbers significantly slows down performance of the Space Center.)</p>

<p><strong>Word Length</strong></p>
<p>Set minimal and maximal length of created words. Both these numbers are inclusive: Specifying 3 and 5 will yield three, four and five letter words.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Language/Source</strong></p>
<p>Select language / source word list to use. By default, word-o-mat uses a freely available and quite large English crossword solvers&rsquo; word list called the UKACD (<a href="http://www.crosswordman.com/wordlist.html">UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary</a>). Word-o-mat now also includes 11 shorter word lists for Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Slovak, Spanish and Swedish, all of which can be handily selected here. More languages will be added in later versions. These lists are derived from the freely redistributable word lists compiled from movie subtitles by <a href="http://invokeit.wordpress.com/frequency-word-lists/">Hermit Dave of Invoke IT</a>.<br>
In addition to the language-specific selection there are two extra options: Using your Mac&rsquo;s internal words dictionary, or a custom word list. This needs to be a .txt file with words on separate lines, using UTF-8 encoding. The script will disregard any lines that contain spaces.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Case</strong></p>
<p>Select whether you want to look at words as they are provided, or converted to all lowercase, all uppercase, or with their first letter capitalized.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Character set selection</strong></p>
<p>Select which set of characters to use for making words:<br>
- Use any characters; if they do not exist in the current font they will simply not be displayed in the Space Center.<br>
- Limit to characters in current font: This will make words using only characters that are available in the current font; this uses the Unicode information, so make sure you have your codepoints assigned properly.<br>
- Limit to selected glyphs: If you want to proof/test a subset of your existing glyphs, just select the glyphs to use in the Font Collection window and select this option.<br>
For obvious reasons, this selection is only active if you have a font open.</p>

<p><strong>Required characters</strong></p>
<p>Enter characters that must be contained in all returned words (comma- or space-delimited list). You can use accented characters here; please just enter the characters themselves (not their names).</p>

<p><strong>Groups</strong></p>
<p>You can define up to three groups or sets of characters, and word-o-mat will look for words that contain at least one character from each of the specified groups. You can choose from presets (letters with ascenders, descenders, arches, diagonals, and ball-and-stick letters) or just type in your own (comma- or space-delimited list). Make sure not to select groups that contradict other options (don't select lowercase groups if you want all caps).<br>
You can use accented characters in these fields; please enter the characters themselves (not their names).</p>

<p><strong>No repeating characters</strong></p>
<p>Excludes words in which one or more characters occur more than once. Can be useful when generating words for sketching.</p>

<p><strong>Words please!</strong></p>
<p>Submit button. Makes words.</p>
