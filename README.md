# word-o-mat v4.0 a 

![word-o-mat screenshot](/screenshot.png)

Word-o-mat now auto-builds the list available in the drop down from the file system inside 

` ~/word-o-mat.glyphsPlugin/Contents/Resources/dictionaries `

The plug-in now has two drop-down menus: one to select the writing system (Latin, Arabic, Cyrillic, N’Ko, Tifinagh, Bengali, Devanagari, Hebrew, Korean) and one to select the language (we added Arabic, Farsi, Bulgarian, Russian, Bambara, Romanian, Maninka, Tifinagh, Korean, Bengali, Turkish, Hindi). 

We invite fellow designers and developers to help us review and expand the word lists.

Thank you İbrahim Kaçtıoğlu for providing word lists, found in fork of Stack and Justify.
